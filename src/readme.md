Notes:
1. The grid has a built-in virtualization, but it's for the row display, not for the data fetching. Another possibility is utilizing simple pagination.
2. I omitted the filtering as it isn't mentioned in the instructions, but it is a simple job to add it in if you so wish
3. Making a custom tooltip should been easy enough but I failed :/ not even the browser default tooltip
4. The token is hard coded
5. All sort of shortcuts in the css and TS
